      # Get all child +Documents+ to this +Document+, going n levels deep if
      # necessary. This is used when calling update persistence operations from
      # the root document, where changes in the entire tree need to be
      # determined. Note that persistence from the embedded documents will
      # always be preferred, since they are optimized calls... This operation
      # can get expensive in domains with large hierarchies.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      # <tt>person._children</tt>

      # Returns:
      #
      # All child +Documents+ to this +Document+ in the entire hierarchy.
